### 1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project is a thermostat firmware designed to control room temperature based on user-defined set points. It reads temperature from a sensor, controls an LED to indicate heating status, and allows users to adjust the set point with buttons. This project solves the problem of providing a simple and effective way to regulate room temperature in various environments.

### 2. What did you do particularly well?
I believe I handled the task scheduling aspect particulary well. The task scheduler efficiently manages multiple tasks, ensuring timely execution and synchronization of actions such as temperature reading, LED control, and user input processing.

----
### 3. Where could you improve?
I could have improved error handling, code organization, and optimization. While the code provides basic error handling, implementing more robust error detection and recovery mechanisms would enhance the reliability of the firmware. Additionally, further structuring and modularization could improve readability and scalability. There are also oppurtunities to optimize certain parts of the code for better performance and resource utilization.

### 4. What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Online forums, like Stack Overflow and TI community forum, were helpful for troubleshooting and knowledge sharing. Referring to manufacturer documentation and online tutorials for specific hardware and software tools used in embedded systems development was a very useful tool that I added to my support network. Finally, feedback from my professor helped me identify areas for improvement and best practices.

### 5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Understanding how to manage multiple tasks efficiently and synchronize their execution is a skill from this project that will be transferable to other projects and course work. I also gained experience in designing and implementing state machines for controlling system behaviour and managing state transitions. 

----
### 6. How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make this proeject maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I organized my code into logical sections with descriptive comments and meaningful function names to enhance readability. I also broke down functionality into separate modules and functions to improve maintainability and facilitate future modifications. I followed coding standards and best practices to ensure consistency and readability across the codebase. I also provided comprehensive documentation throughout the code and task scheduler documentation to explain the functionality, usage, and dependencies.
